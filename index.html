<ul><li>
  Jazious Carmankles were first discovered by San Juan de Pantalones in the
  year 1592, as part of his expedition to a previously unexplored region of the
  new world. He first described them as a cross between a breadfruit and a cravat,
  though later said they most resembled his ex-wife.

  The name Jazious Carmankle was given to this strange item by Senor Pantalones
  because his ship's name was Jazious Carmankle. Why his ship was
  named that is a story for another time and place.
