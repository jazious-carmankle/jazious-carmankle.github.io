<h5 class='section-title'>What is a Jazious Carmankle?</h5>
<ul><li>
  Jazious Carmankles were first discovered by San Juan de Pantalones in the
  year 1592, as part of his expedition to a previously unexplored region of the
  new world. He first described them as a cross between breadfruit and a cravat,
  though later said they most resembled his ex-wife.

  The name Jazious Carmankle was given to this strange item by the brave explorer
  because his ship's name was Jazious Carmankle and he wasn't a very creative
  person. Why his ship was named that is a story for another time and place.
